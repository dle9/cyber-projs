# modes
- Windows OS functions in two main modes
- user mode: where most apps and user processes operate
	- limit access to system resources, must interact with OS through APIs
	- isolated from eachother
- kernel mode: unrestricted access to resources, hardware, functions

# api call flow
- example
	- User mode
		- user application calls ReadProcessMemory api func
		- this request goes to kernel32
			- NtReadVirtualMemory
		- this request goes to NTDLL
			- system call
	- kernel mode
		- syscall table
			- contains pointer to the corresponding kernel function
		- return from sys call
	- user mode
		- NTDLL > Kernel32 > User app
