* first pmat lab: 
- malware is most dangerous when in transit
- how to transfer malware from host to VM?
	- add an extension, e.g., ".exe.malware"
		- off the top of my head: 
			"curl <download link> -outfile <filepath>/super_safe_app.exe.malware 
	- malware should be zipped and password encrypted!
		- standard password is "infected"
