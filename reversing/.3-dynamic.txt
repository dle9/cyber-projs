* also known as heuristic and behavioral
* types of indicators:
	- host indicators: deletes a file, installs persistence
	- network indicators: calls out to domain, downloads a file

=============================================== Malware.Unknown.exe ==================================================

=== NETWORK INDICATORS
# run inetsim and wireshark on remnux

# review the strings found from static analysis of the Unknown malware. 

# in wireshark, start sniffing and add query:
http.request.full_uri contains favicon.ico
	# favicon is the icon you see next to a browser tab title

# run the malware

# in wireshark, note down the discovered evidence (u should see http request with the favicon query)

=== HOST INDICATORS 
# revert to clean state

# unzip the unknown malware again

# open procmon

# add a filter:
Process name > is > Malware.unknown.exe

# run the malware, see results

# look back at static analysis. what else can you add?

# add the CR.... file path as a filter

# why was this file created?

# recall this is the inetsim executable created from the fake internet setup. to test this, just go to fakewebsite.com/completely_safe_malware.exe, which should download that blank executable

# let's take a look at more host indicators. from the static analysis, see the string: "cmd.exe /C ping 1.1.1.1 -n 1 -w 3000 > Nul & Del /f /q "%s""

# this looks like it deletes itself from disk if it can't connect to the internet. test this theory by turning off inetsim

# go in procmon and search for this string
