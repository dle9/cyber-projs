# x64/x32dbg

# initial
- run the packed malware to reach entry point
- can place first BP on return of VirtualAlloc (or API of interest) 
	- use (Ctrl + G) to find an expression
- step over, step over, step over, see CALL -- step into

# Breakpoints
- if you see a loop, place breakpoint after it, then F9 for run. remove the BP if  you want
- may also BP after return operation
- also add BP at end of loop to see where it is returning to
- a JMP to a 401XXX address is interesting, if panel below asm code shows "Jump not taken," (with a BP on the JMP instruction) keep running until jump is taken and step into it

# information 
- if see some operations on registers, right click register on right side panel, then "Follow in [Dump]"
- if debugger is showing unknown/blank data, right click , Analysis > Remove analysis from..., to view the original code

# export
- plugins > OllyDump > dump debug process
	- note the entry point of the first instruction of unpacked malware
- uncheck "Rebuild imports"
- Import Reconstructor tool > change entry point (OEP) to the EP of the unpacked malware > AutoSearch

# nop
- stuck on a part of the program? nop that shit!!!!!!!!!!
